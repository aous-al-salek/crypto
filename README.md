# Crypto
Performance comparison between CBC-DES, CBC-TDES, CBC-AES128, CBC-AES192, and CBC-AES256.
Performance is measured in Python 3.9.2 and the encryption algorithms are implemented in PyCryptodome 3.15.0.
The results are given in microseconds as an average of 1000000 runs using 1000 different keys.
The test was performed on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 8GB of RAM and a SanDisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC card.
The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B was powered using a Raspberry Pi Official USB-C Power Supply rated at 5.1V / 3.0A DC output.
The Raspberry Pi OS 11 Desktop 32-bit operating system was used (built on Debian 11 bullseye) with kernel version 5.15 and released on 2022-09-06.
The Raspberry Pi ran EEPROM version 2022-04-26.

On 2023-05-05 a performance benchmark of Ascon-128, Ascon-128a, and Ascon-80pq was added to the results and the code. The same methodology was utilized.
An important difference is that the implementation Ascon used for the comparison is [pyascon](https://github.com/meichlseder/pyascon).
This difference may be the explanation for why the results of the Ascon cipher are not as optimal as the other ciphers despite the Ascon cipher being lightweight.
This will certainly change in the near future as implementations of the relatively new algorithm mature over time.
Please understand that the results of the Ascon cipher are certainly not representative of what the final standard will offer.
As of 2023-05-05, NIST has only selected the algorithm for standardization, meaning that no standard has been published yet [Learn more](https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2023/lightweight-cryptography-nist-selects-ascon).
